# Shell Scripts


Some basic Shell Scripts that I have written for practice and daily use.

<ul>
    <li>Create Lecture Folders:</li>
        Creates a series of folders for given lectures in lectures.txt
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Create REST API:</li>
        Creates a basic REST API with 4 methods for one endpoint with FastAPI that installed in a virtual environment.
</ul>
